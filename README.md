# Clothing Reviews Sentiment Analysis ðŸ‘—ðŸ“Š

## About the Project
This project analyzes **23,486 womenâ€™s clothing reviews** (raw dataset) to classify sentiment and generate actionable business insights.  
After cleaning and preprocessing, **22,641 reviews** were retained for analysis.  
Through advanced NLP techniques and multiple machine learning models, the system achieves an **F1-Score of 92.2%** (SVM) while uncovering customer satisfaction trends, demographic insights, and product performance patterns.
